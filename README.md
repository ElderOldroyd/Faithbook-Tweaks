njmmScripts is about to undergo a huge rewrite from the core. This will allow the Add on to work much more effectively and easier to use for the layman. It will also be faster, easier to customize, and harder to identify as a “robot” by facebook.


Anticipated changes include:
-Relocating and reworking the control panel on individual Facebook pages to make it easier to use and to look at.
-Changing the Profile picture hiding feature to use CSS (a far more effective way at hiding profiles) to change the source.
-Adding a toolbar button that will open up a menu with links to each of the individual tools, as well as an options menu.
-Adding a page, based on Elder Berret’s modified “Search is Back” that will make it easier to target certain demographics on Facebook and facilitate sending Friend Requests faster.
-Automatically refresh the clearing Friend requests page so that it is even easier to use for the layman, and is more likely to actually clear all requests
-Increasing and Adding a random modifier to the time between automatically clicking buttons so that Facebook is less likely to detect the add-on as a “robot”
-Quickly unfriending people in certain cities
-Allowing the control panel (with Add Friend Button) to be injected using a menu option.


Eventual Changes include:
-Scheduling the clearing and adding the friend requests to be done automatically based on day and time
-Adding a button to automate how potential friend requests are chosen.
-Allowing searches for certain types of people directly in the omnibox (URL bar).


Immediate TODO:
1. Make the add-on update automatically.
2. Allow a way to unhide selected images that were hidden.











# NJMM Facebook Tweaks

NJMM Facebook Tweaks is an assorted set of tools to make Facebook Proselyting safer and more effective for missionaries in the New Jersey Morristown Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

It adds tools that help avoid distractions involving images and videos, that help accelerate the adding/removing of friends, accelerate the clearing of sent friend requests, and other tweaks to make proselyting easier.

## Motivation
This project was designed because there are many parts of Facebook Proselyting which can be laborious or even dangerous for the missionary. President Hess asked for a profile-picture-hiding feature. The button-pressing features were designed for two purposes--first, to increase missionary productivity, and second, to provide an incentive to use the profile-picture-hiding feature. Other features came as a matter of convenience. 

For a more complete history see the [history section](#history).


## How to use?
For add-on installation instructions on a Missionary Device, please see [the Google Doc Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kUkHjOrEi5VA7i--fU8NDWsYWsXIjio2my3_EprIk6Q/edit?usp=drivesdk). This will eventually be duplicated here for convenience. 


## Features
The NJMM Tweaks adds a variety of tools to Facebook within the firefox browser to assist in online proselyting. These features include:
Automatically hiding profile pictures, and (optionally) newsfeeds, videos, and all other images
A new way of searching for potential friends
Automated sending of friend requests
Automated friend request clearing
Automatically unfriending of people based on user-defined filters
Some cosmetic adjustments

## History

# Developer Stuff

## Build status
Currently, the project is maintained on a google drive. This makes “Build Status” a very complicated topic. More or less, It's in a state of constant development, and it's expected to always build properly. We are considering moving to a github project to make build status easier to maintain and branch, etc… 

## Code style
Please try to match the coding style and especially comment style for each function and individual lines. This is passed down so frequently that code needs to be thoroughly explained. Remember, code written 6 months ago is indistinguishable from code written by someone else. Focus more on the <i>WHY</i> rather than the <i>HOW</i> of algorithms and functions.
 

## Tech/framework used
Ex. -

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)



## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.


## Contribute
Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
